              The Rising at Dawn Fund for Women is a proposed initiative designed to support women who are pursuing
              education, returning to school, or launching their first business. Inspired by the quiet power of morning
              rituals, this fund honors the unseen work women do to build new chapters of their lives.

              opening the doors to the business they are brave enough to build. The Rising at Dawn Fund for Women exists
              to support those moments of becoming.

            It is dedicated to women who carry ambition and responsibility side by side, and who understand that growth
            often happens in the quietest hours. The fund supports those moments of becoming, when a decision to rise is
            also a decision to invest in the future.

            <p class="body">
              The Rising at Dawn Fund for Women aims to support at least 25 women annually through educational scholarships
              and small business startup grants. Each recipient represents a new beginning, a renewed sense of possibility,
              and a future shaped by intention.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
              This vision reflects a belief that luxury can be both beautiful and purposeful. That innovation and care can
              coexist. That a brand can elevate experience while expanding access to opportunity.
